            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Here are some facts about the Philippines</p>
        </div>


        <div class="facts-card"> 
            <figcaption>
                <h2>Philippines</h2>
                <p>Philippines, island country of Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. Manila is the capital, but nearby Quezon City is the country’s most-populous city. Both are part of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), located on Luzon, the largest island. The second largest island of the Philippines is Mindanao, in the southeast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West. It is, for example, the second most-populous Asian country (following India) with English as an official language and one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia (the other being East Timor). Despite the prominence of such Anglo-European cultural characteristics, the peoples of the Philippines are Asian in consciousness and aspiration.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The country was wracked by political turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. After enduring more than a decade of authoritarian rule under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, the broadly popular People Power movement in 1986 led a bloodless uprising against the regime. The confrontation resulted not only in the ouster and exile of Marcos but also in the restoration of democratic government to the Philippines</p>
                <br>
                <p>Contemporary Filipinos continue to grapple with a society that is replete with paradoxes, perhaps the most obvious being the presence of extreme wealth alongside tremendous poverty. Rich in resources, the Philippines has the potential to build a strong industrial economy, but the country remains largely agricultural. Especially toward the end of the 20th century, rapid industrial expansion was spurred by a high degree of domestic and foreign investment. That growth, however, simultaneously contributed to severe degradation of the environment. The Philippines also emerged as a regional leader in education during the late 20th century, with a well-established public school and university system, and by the early 21st century the country had one of the highest literacy rates in Asia.</p>

                <h2>Land</h2>
                <p>The Philippine archipelago is bounded by the Philippine Sea to the east, the Celebes Sea to the south, the Sulu Sea to the southwest, and the South China Sea to the west and north. The islands spread out in the shape of a triangle, with those south of Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago, and the island of Mindanao outlining (from west to east, respectively) its southern base and the Batan Islands to the north of Luzon forming its apex. Historically, the total number of islands in the archipelago was held to be 7,107, but in 2016 the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority of the Philippines announced the discovery of more than 500 previously uncharted islands. The archipelago stretches about 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from north to south, and its widest east-west extent, at its southern base, is some 700 miles (1,130 km). The island of Taiwan lies north of the Batan group, the Malaysian portion of the island of Borneo is to the south of Palawan, and the eastern islands of Indonesia lie to the south and southeast of Mindanao. Only about two-fifths of the islands and islets have names, and only some 350 have areas of 1 square mile (2.6 square km) or more. The large islands fall into three groups: (1) the Luzon group in the north and west, consisting of Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan, (2) the Visayas group in the centre, consisting of Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Masbate, Negros, Panay, and Samar, and (3) Mindanao in the south.</p>

                    <h2>Population</h2>
                    <p>109,035,343</p>
                    <p>T2020 Census of Population and Housing (2020 CPH) Population Counts Declared Official by the President. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced today that based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing (2020 CPH), the total population of the Philippines as of 01 May 2020 is at 109,035,343.</p>

                    <h2>Culture</h2>
                    <p>Philippine society is a unique blend of diversity and homogeneity. Although geographically part of Southeast Asia, the country is culturally strongly Euro-American. Forces of assimilation have constantly worked to overcome cultural differences between the various ethnic groups that are scattered—sometimes in relative isolation—throughout the archipelago. Nearly four centuries of Western rule, however, have left an indelible imprint on the Philippines, serving as a conduit for the introduction of Western culture and as the catalyst for the emergence of a sense of Philippine political and cultural unity. While the Christian churches built by the Spanish and the mosques built by the Muslims provided a spiritual anchor, the educational system established by the United States and expanded by the Filipinos has become emblematic of cultural unity and socioeconomic progress. Nonetheless, through the persistence of strong family ties, the revival of the barangay as the smallest unit of government, increased attention to Asian history and literature, and subsequent revival of dormant traditions, the Philippines has strengthened its Asian heritage without abandoning its Western cultural acquisitions.</p>

                    <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
                    <img src="spanishcolonization.jpg" alt="Spanish Colonization">
                    <p> The Spanish colonization of the Philippines began in 1565 when Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi arrived and established the first permanent Spanish settlement on the island of Cebu. This marked the beginning of over 300 years of Spanish rule in the Philippines, which lasted until 1898. </p>
                    <p> Key Phases of Colonization: </p>\
                    <p> Exploration and Settlement (1521-1571): </p>
                    <p> Spanish contact with the Philippines began in 1521 when Ferdinand Magellan arrived, but his death at the hands of Lapu-Lapu delayed colonization efforts. It wasn't until 1565 that Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu. From there, Spanish influence expanded across the archipelago, culminating in the capture of Manila in 1571. Manila became the capital and a strategic trading hub, marking the start of formal Spanish rule. This period laid the groundwork for nearly 300 years of Spanish domination. </p>
                    <p> Political and Religious Control: </p>
                    <p> Spain established a centralized government system in the Philippines, ruled by a Governor-General who acted on behalf of the Spanish monarchy. The country was integrated into the Spanish Empire and was governed as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Catholic missionaries, especially from the Augustinian, Dominican, and Jesuit orders, played a key role in spreading Christianity and converting most Filipinos. The Catholic Church became highly influential, controlling large amounts of land and acting as a political force. This resulted in a deep intertwining of politics and religion, with Catholicism becoming a cornerstone of Filipino society. </p>
                    <p> Economic Changes: </p>
                    <p> The Philippines became a crucial part of the trans-Pacific Galleon Trade between Manila and Acapulco, facilitating global trade between Asia and the Americas. This brought economic opportunities but also linked the colony to the larger Spanish imperial economy. The encomienda system granted Spanish settlers control over local lands and labor, forcing Filipinos to pay tribute and work for them. This disrupted indigenous economic practices and led to the exploitation of many local communities. Though the galleon trade enriched Spanish merchants, most Filipinos remained impoverished under colonial rule. </p>
                    <p> Resistance and Revolts: </p>
                    <p> Throughout the Spanish colonization, Filipinos resisted foreign rule in various ways, including revolts and rebellions. One of the longest was the Dagohoy Rebellion (1744–1829), lasting nearly 85 years, fueled by grievances over Spanish exploitation and forced labor. In the southern Philippines, the Muslim population, known as Moros, fiercely resisted both Spanish control and Christian conversion efforts. Their resistance prevented Spain from fully controlling Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. Despite these uprisings, Spanish forces were able to suppress most revolts until the late 19th century. </p>
                    <p> Decline and End of Spanish Rule: </p>
                    <p> By the late 19th century, dissatisfaction with Spanish rule grew due to corruption, economic inequality, and nationalist sentiments. The Philippine Revolution erupted in 1896, led by figures like José Rizal and Andrés Bonifacio, aiming to end Spanish oppression. The revolution weakened Spanish control, and their defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the final blow. Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris, officially ending more than 300 years of Spanish colonization. This transition set the stage for a new chapter of American rule in the Philippines. </p>
                    <p> The Spanish colonization of the Philippines profoundly shaped the country’s social, political, and religious landscape, leaving a legacy that is still visible today, especially in its widespread Catholicism and cultural customs. </p>
